    "- numpy arrays are more versatile and feature-rich than arrays created with the array package. numpy arrays support a wide range of operations, \n",
    "including advanced indexing, slicing, element-wise arithmetic operations, broadcasting, array reshaping, and aggregations. array objects, \n",
    "in comparison, have more limited functionality and lack many of the advanced array operations provided by numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy is known for its optimized and efficient implementation of array operations. It utilizes low-level languages like C and Fortran, \n",
    "as well as optimized algorithms, which can provide significant performance improvements compared to using plain Python lists or \n",
